<!-- WHAT IS HAPPPENING?!? -->

## Quick questions to ask your task-giver

1. Would you like a small normalize stylesheet (modern-normalize) added so browsers render controls and spacing more consistently while keeping native behaviors and accessibility? It’s lightweight and avoids re-declaring many sensible defaults.

2. Or would you prefer a mini-reset (box-sizing: border-box, remove body margin, img max-width:100%) to give us a fully predictable layout base without pulling in a large reset? Mini-resets are compact and easy to reason about.

3. Should the baseline be a local vendor file added before `styles.css` for offline reproducibility, or a CDN link for quick sharing? Local copies make demos reliable; CDNs are convenient but less portable.

4. Do you want a few safe global tweaks applied (box-sizing, img/object-fit, inputs inherit font) to prevent layout issues across devices? Those are low-risk changes that improve visual stability and are simple to revert.
